# Experimental Web CV/Résumé

This is an experimental HTML5 CV/Resumé using some Flexbox, pseudo-elements, custom attributes, SCSS, Zepto/jQuery and a little Angular.js in the front-end.

For the back-end, this application uses Node.js with Express and Gulp as the task runner. The configuration is inspired by [this Nitrous.io tutorial ](http://help.nitrous.io/setting-up-gulp-with-livereload-and-sass/), with some modifications due to changes in versions and other things.

## Installation and running

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required Node dependencies using: `npm install`
3. Run the site simply using: `gulp`

# Web CV/Résumé

This is an experimental HTML5 CV/Resumé using some Flexbox, pseudo-elements, custom attributes, SCSS and Zepto/jQuery.

For the back-end, this application uses Node.js with Express and Gulp as the task runner. The configuration is inspired by [this Nitrous.io tutorial ](http://help.nitrous.io/setting-up-gulp-with-livereload-and-sass/), with some modifications due to changes in versions and other things.
